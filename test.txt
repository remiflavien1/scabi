-------------- Package: <urllib3> --------------

CVE : CVE-2020-7212
CVE DETAIL https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-7212
DESCRIPTION The _encode_invalid_chars function in util/url.py in the urllib3 library 1.25.2 through 1.25.7 for Python allows a denial of service (CPU consumption) because of an inefficient algorithm. The percent_encodings array contains all matches of percent encodings. It is not deduplicated. For a URL of length N, the size of percent_encodings may be up to O(N). The next step (normalize existing percent-encoded bytes) also takes up to O(N) for each step, so the total time is O(N^2). If percent_encodings were deduplicated, the time to compute _encode_invalid_chars would be O(kN), where k is at most 484 ((10+6*2)^2).


CVE : CVE-2019-11324

CVE : CVE-2019-1706
CVE DETAIL https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1706
DESCRIPTION A vulnerability in the software cryptography module of the Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv) and Firepower 2100 Series running Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an unexpected reload of the device that results in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a logic error with how the software cryptography module handles IPsec sessions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating and sending traffic in a high number of IPsec sessions through the targeted device. A successful exploit could cause the device to reload and result in a DoS condition.


CVE : CVE-2019-11841
CVE DETAIL https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11841
DESCRIPTION A message-forgery issue was discovered in crypto/openpgp/clearsign/clearsign.go in supplementary Go cryptography libraries 2019-03-25. According to the OpenPGP Message Format specification in RFC 4880 chapter 7, a cleartext signed message can contain one or more optional "Hash" Armor Headers. The "Hash" Armor Header specifies the message digest algorithm(s) used for the signature. However, the Go clearsign package ignores the value of this header, which allows an attacker to spoof it. Consequently, an attacker can lead a victim to believe the signature was generated using a different message digest algorithm than what was actually used. Moreover, since the library skips Armor Header parsing in general, an attacker can not only embed arbitrary Armor Headers, but also prepend arbitrary text to cleartext messages without invalidating the signatures.


CVE : CVE-2019-11840
CVE DETAIL https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11840
DESCRIPTION An issue was discovered in supplementary Go cryptography libraries, aka golang-googlecode-go-crypto, before 2019-03-20. A flaw was found in the amd64 implementation of golang.org/x/crypto/salsa20 and golang.org/x/crypto/salsa20/salsa. If more than 256 GiB of keystream is generated, or if the counter otherwise grows greater than 32 bits, the amd64 implementation will first generate incorrect output, and then cycle back to previously generated keystream. Repeated keystream bytes can lead to loss of confidentiality in encryption applications, or to predictability in CSPRNG applications.


CVE : CVE-2019-11341
CVE DETAIL https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11341
DESCRIPTION On certain Samsung P(9.0) phones, an attacker with physical access can start a TCP Dump capture without the user's knowledge. This feature of the Service Mode application is available after entering the *#9900# check code, but is protected by an OTP password. However, this password is created locally and (due to mishandling of cryptography) can be obtained easily by reversing the password creation logic.


CVE : CVE-2018-9028
CVE DETAIL https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-9028
DESCRIPTION Weak cryptography used for passwords in CA Privileged Access Manager 2.x reduces the complexity for password cracking.

CVE : CVE-2018-19784
CVE DETAIL https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-19784
DESCRIPTION The str_rot_pass function in vendor/atholn1600/php-proxy/src/helpers.php in PHP-Proxy 5.1.0 uses weak cryptography, which makes it easier for attackers to calculate the authorization data needed for local file inclusion.


CVE : CVE-2018-12438
CVE DETAIL https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12438
DESCRIPTION The Elliptic Curve Cryptography library (aka sunec or libsunec) allows a memory-cache side-channel attack on ECDSA signatures, aka the Return Of the Hidden Number Problem or ROHNP. To discover an ECDSA key, the attacker needs access to either the local machine or a different virtual machine on the same physical host.


CVE : CVE-2018-10903
CVE DETAIL https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10903
DESCRIPTION A flaw was found in python-cryptography versions between >=1.9.0 and <2.3. The finalize_with_tag API did not enforce a minimum tag length. If a user did not validate the input length prior to passing it to finalize_with_tag an attacker could craft an invalid payload with a shortened tag (e.g. 1 byte) such that they would have a 1 in 256 chance of passing the MAC check. GCM tag forgeries can cause key leakage.
